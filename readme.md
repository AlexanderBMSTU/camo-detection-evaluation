# Generation of camoflage patterns using DCGAN

## Info

Some practical camo generation to avoid detection
based on [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) and [DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow). Combined for research in BMSTU.

## Sructure

* camo-evaluation:
  * Searching camo patterns robust for detection;
  * Evaluation of camo generated by DCGAN;
* camo-generation:
  * Trainig GAN for generating camo patterns robust for detection based on real ones.
